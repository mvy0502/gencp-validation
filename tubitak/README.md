Generating synthetic satellite imagery from OpenStreetMap vector data with **pix2pix**
(a conditional GAN). This folder (`tubitak/`) holds the internship work and is kept
separate so it never collides with upstream (`telespazio-tim/GenCP`) files.

- **Setup date:** 18 August 2026
- **Repository root:** `~/Documents/GenCP-Generative-Goruntu-Uretimi-OpenStreetMap`
- **Working branch:** `tubitak-tr` (upstream's default branch is `master`)
- **Hardware:** MacBook Pro, Apple M4 Max (arm64), 36 GB RAM — no CUDA, runs on CPU
- **GPU work:** Kaggle (2× T4) for the phase-C trainings; Modal (A10G) for the seed
  replication since 25 August 2026 — see `kaggle/` and `modal/`
- **Taking over this project?** Start from the handover guide: [DEVIR.md](DEVIR.md)

## Findings summary

Six findings from the first week, each measured rather than asserted, and each written up with its
method, numbers and falsification criteria. When this summary was written nothing had been fixed in
the pipeline; since then the affine correction (Option A) has been hard-wired into the reference
tool ([`tool/gencp_ref.py`](tool/gencp_ref.py)) — the rest of the later work is summarised in
[Where things moved since](#where-things-moved-since-updated-25-august-2026) below.

| # | finding | status | where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Georeferencing scale error.** `gencp_georeferencing.py` pairs a 256-px grid with a 257-px source transform: true GSD 10.0390625 m vs 10.0 declared, **+0.390625 % = exactly 1/256**. Zero at the NW corner, **14.1 m at the SE corner**. | **Confirmed 4 ways**, including KARIOS at **9.9σ** | [geometry-finding.md](docs/geometry-finding.md) |
| 2 | **Network alignment is not a contributor.** Equivariance certified to **0.008 px (8 cm)**; the absolute offset is **exactly 0** analytically, since `p == (k−s)/2` holds at every layer. | Settled | [geometry-finding.md §11](docs/geometry-finding.md) |
| 3 | **Train/inference scale mismatch.** Training resizes 257→286 + random crop, inference 257→256 — the model sees content **11.7 % coarser** at inference. | Real but **not worth acting on**: arm C is geometrically cleanest yet matches no better (paired t = +0.59) | [train-test-scale-mismatch.md](docs/train-test-scale-mismatch.md) |
| 4 | **The generator invents structure.** It emits **2.1× the edge density of its OSM input** and matches the real satellite's busyness (ratio 0.996) *regardless* of what the input specifies. | Confirmed; **no usable threshold** — rank sites, don't filter them | [hallucinated-structure.md](docs/hallucinated-structure.md) |
| 5 | **Sparse OSM chips lose positional accuracy — and this is GenCP-specific.** rho = **−0.61** (partial, controlling for point count) between OSM edge density and residual. A ceiling control on *real* imagery gives **rho ≈ +0.06, null** — so it is not generic matchability. | Confirmed with the real instrument | [karios-validation.md §10](docs/karios-validation.md) |
| 6 | **Dataset defects** for an upstream report: 9 leaked test chips, 25 demo/train overlaps, 323 of 566 OSM halves not byte-identical to their georeferenced raster. | Recorded | [geometry-finding.md §12](docs/geometry-finding.md) |

### Where things moved since (updated 25 August 2026)

The findings above are the end-of-week-1 state. The later work, in rough order (full record in the
git log and [docs/corrections-log.md](docs/corrections-log.md)):

* **Reference tool.** [`tool/gencp_ref.py`](tool/gencp_ref.py) — deterministic GenCP reference
  generator with the Option-A corrected transform hard-wired (no uncorrected code path exists);
  byte-exact reruns verified — [tool-results.md](docs/tool-results.md).
* **Phase C: 2×2 loss factorial.** C1 (GAN+L1) and C2 (L1-only) retrained from scratch on Kaggle,
  then the LPIPS halves (C4/C5) — [phase-c-results.md](docs/phase-c-results.md),
  [phase-c-lpips-results.md](docs/phase-c-lpips-results.md); headline measurements B1–B3 in
  [headline-results.md](docs/headline-results.md).
* **Benchmarks against real imagery.** T1: real imagery outperforms the synthetic reference
  decisively where it exists — [T1-benchmark-results.md](docs/T1-benchmark-results.md); T3:
  reliability layer ships as a recommendation — [T3-reliability-results.md](docs/T3-reliability-results.md).
* **Positioning (E1–E3).** All three measured premises behind the synthetic-reference rationale
  fail as stated, with caveats recorded — [positioning-results.md](docs/positioning-results.md).
* **Turkish pipeline.** Ankara acquisition complete and verified
  ([ankara-acquisition.md](docs/ankara-acquisition.md)); the rasteriser failed its KARIOS
  acceptance gate pending a land-cover base layer ([renderer-tolerance.md](docs/renderer-tolerance.md)).
* **Seed-level replication.** All factorial inference moved to the seed level
  ([seed-replication-registration.md](docs/seed-replication-registration.md)); the GPU work moved
  from Kaggle to Modal (A10G) via [`modal/gencp_modal.py`](modal/gencp_modal.py) — gate running as
  of 25 August.
* **Paper.** A GRSL letter scoped to the loss-function result — [paper-roadmap.md](docs/paper-roadmap.md).
* **Reports.** Turkish progress report in `rapor2/`, final report in `rapor3/` (sources versioned,
  rendered PDFs reproducible via `rapor3/build_pdf.py` and kept out of git).

### What the KARIOS run established

* **On upstream's own statistic we are 4.5× better**, not worse. Their "mean error 0.7 px" is
  KARIOS's `mean_x`/`mean_y` — the *global systematic shift* — not a per-point error magnitude. Our
  arm B gives **0.155 px** against their 0.70 px, and per-axis RMSE 1.03/0.91 px against their 2.50.
  An earlier claim that we were "3× worse" was based on comparing two different quantities and has
  been withdrawn. The full record of corrections — including those where the run, not the
  record, was corrected — is in [docs/corrections-log.md](docs/corrections-log.md).
* **Correcting the affine reduces the global shift by 40.3 %** (against 6.1 % on the per-point mean),
  because a scale error is systematic and a signed mean is what captures it.
* **The ~2 px noise floor is local matching, not our setup.** Variance decomposition puts **~95 %
  within-chip**; our ground-truth construction is not inflating the measurements.

### Turkish pipeline — status

**Turkey is absent from the training corpus.** It spans UTM zones 30-34 (western/central Europe);
Turkey is in zones 35-38, ~520 km further east. Running the pretrained model on Turkish data is
therefore a **genuine geographic generalisation test**, which is the stronger experiment.

The OSM rasteriser is **built and fitted** (edge profile matched to 0.023 px; palette an exact
subset; geometry identical) but **FAILED its KARIOS acceptance gate** (+0.55 px, −24 % points,
11/30 chips with zero key points). Diagnosis: the reference rasters are OSM vectors composited
over a **per-pixel land-cover base layer** (the released `CLC_color_mapping`'s purpose) — sea and
large water (74 % of reference water) and forest speckle texture come from that raster, not from
OSM. See [renderer-tolerance.md](docs/renderer-tolerance.md) §4. Adding a land-cover base
(e.g. ESA WorldCover 10 m) is the identified fix, deliberately not implemented pending decision.

Ankara acquisition is complete and verified: see [ankara-acquisition.md](docs/ankara-acquisition.md). The palette is pinned down from data (11 colours, closed), but
the renderer is not: the one released colour table is demonstrably not the one used (buildings
missing, three colours never rendered), and 45 % of every raster is anti-aliasing from unknown
tooling. See [osm-palette.md](docs/osm-palette.md) §7 for the recommended next step.

### Priority order this implies

1. **Site selection** — the largest lever by a wide margin. Rank AOIs by OSM information content.
2. **Affine correction** (Option A) — worth doing for correctness; a 40 % improvement on the
   systematic-shift statistic, but small against total error.
3. **Inference scale** — leave alone; measured and rejected on a task-based metric.

### Practical note

KARIOS is **single-threaded** (measured: 19.7 s per chip, `user` ≈ `real`). On this 14-core machine
the runs are embarrassingly parallel — running 8-wide cut a 25-minute batch to about 3 minutes.
Worth doing for any full campaign.

## Environment setup

Miniforge was installed (conda-forge, native Apple Silicon) — **not** Anaconda.

```bash
brew install --cask miniforge
conda init zsh
conda create -n gencp python=3.11 -y
conda activate gencp
conda install -c conda-forge rasterio osmnx geopandas matplotlib jupyterlab visdom -y
pip install torch torchvision dominate wandb
```

### Recreating the environment from scratch (TWO steps — the second is mandatory)

```bash
conda env create -f tubitak/environment.yml
conda activate gencp
bash tubitak/scripts/fix_openmp.sh
```

The second step **cannot be skipped**. `environment.yml` alone does not produce a working
environment: installation completes, but `import torch` crashes because of an OpenMP
conflict (see [Known issues](#known-issues--environment-gotchas)). `fix_openmp.sh` is
idempotent — on an already-fixed environment it exits without doing anything.

### Verified versions

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.11.15 |
| torch | 2.13.0 |
| torchvision | 0.28.0 |
| rasterio | 1.4.4 |
| osmnx | 2.1.1 |
| geopandas | 1.1.4 |
| numpy | 2.4.6 |

`torch.backends.mps.is_available()` → **True**. `torch.cuda.is_available()` → `False` (expected).

## Known issues / environment gotchas

This section documents problems hit during setup that **will be hit again**. Neither one
appeared in the reference environment; both are specific to this machine.

### 1. OpenMP conflict — `OMP: Error #15`

**Symptom.** Without doing anything else, just:

```
OMP: Error #15: Initializing libomp.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already initialized.
```

The process dies with `abort` (exit 134). `import torch` **on its own** is enough; nothing
that uses torch works, including `test.py`.

**Root cause.** Two separate OpenMP runtimes are loaded into the same process:

| Source | Runtime it brings |
|---|---|
| conda-forge (`numpy`, `rasterio`, `libopenblas`) | `$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libomp.dylib` (`llvm-openmp`) |
| pip `torch` wheel | `.../site-packages/torch/lib/libomp.dylib` (bundled inside the package) |

conda-forge numpy loads conda's libomp first; torch then tries to initialise its own copy
and the OpenMP guard halts the process. This does not happen when all packages come from a
single source — the problem is created by mixing conda and pip.

**Fix.** Torch's bundled copy is backed up and symlinked to conda's, leaving exactly **one**
OpenMP runtime in the process:

```bash
conda activate gencp
bash tubitak/scripts/fix_openmp.sh
```

**Why `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` was NOT used.** That variable is not a fix — it silences
the guard and permits two runtimes to coexist. As OpenMP's own warning says, this can crash
or **silently produce incorrect results**. In a GAN inference pipeline a silently wrong
number is far worse than a noisy crash: the output still looks plausible but is wrong. The
symlink instead eliminates the problem by leaving a single runtime. Verified: after linking,
the torch↔numpy matmul difference is `0.0`.

**⚠️ It is not permanent.** The symlink lives inside `site-packages`; neither
`environment.yml` nor git captures it. **Any** operation that reinstalls or upgrades torch
(`pip install -U torch`, `pip install --force-reinstall`, deleting and recreating the
environment) restores the bundled copy and brings the crash back. Just run the script again —
it is idempotent, so running it unnecessarily is harmless.

### 2. `visdom` cannot be installed with pip — `pkg_resources`

**Symptom.**

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'
ERROR: Failed to build 'visdom' when getting requirements to build wheel
```

**Root cause.** `visdom`'s `setup.py` imports `pkg_resources`, which setuptools 82 removed.
pip's build-isolation environment installs a current setuptools, so the build fails before
it starts.

**Careful — silent side effect.** pip resolves all dependencies first, so this error aborts
the **entire** command. That means:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision dominate visdom wandb   # ← nothing installs, because of visdom
```

leaves torch uninstalled too. It is easy to miss, because the error message mentions only visdom.

**Fix.** Install visdom from conda-forge and the rest from pip:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge visdom      # 0.2.4
pip install torch torchvision dominate wandb
```

### 3. The VHR demo was not installed

`GenCP_VHR_demo/requirements_VHR.txt` pins `tensorflow==2.10.1` and `gdal==3.6.4`.
There is no macOS arm64 wheel for TensorFlow 2.10.1, so it was left out of scope.
GDAL was not installed separately either — `rasterio` ships its own.

## Model weights

405 MB, downloaded from Zenodo; kept out of the repository by `.gitignore`.

```bash
cd GenCP_HR_demo
curl -L -o HR_weights.zip \
  "https://zenodo.org/records/15044428/files/GenCP_HR_Model_Weights.zip?download=1"
unzip -q HR_weights.zip
mkdir -p checkpoints
cp -r HR_Model_Weights/* checkpoints/
rm -rf HR_weights.zip HR_Model_Weights
```

Result: `checkpoints/genCP_HR_RGB_model/latest_net_G.pth` and
`checkpoints/genCP_HR_B04_model/latest_net_G.pth` (~218 MB each).

## Running the pipeline

All commands are run from inside `GenCP_HR_demo/` with the `gencp` environment active.

### 1. Image generation (CPU)

`--gpu_ids -1` enables CPU mode; no code changes are needed.

```bash
python ../test.py \
  --dataroot "./data/dataset" \
  --name "genCP_HR_RGB_model" \
  --model "test" \
  --results_dir "./data/fake_images" \
  --checkpoints_dir "./checkpoints" \
  --dataset_mode "single" \
  --norm "batch" \
  --netG "unet_256" \
  --gpu_ids -1
```

Expected: `[Network G] Total number of parameters : 54.414 M`.
If this number differs, the wrong model was loaded — stop.

Output: 100 files under `data/fake_images/genCP_HR_RGB_model/test_latest/images/`
(50 `_real.png` + 50 `_fake.png`).

> The test folder contains 630 `.tif` files; only 50 tiles are processed because
> `test.py`'s `--num_test` defaults to 50. Raise `--num_test` for more.

### 2. Georeferencing

```bash
python gencp_georeferencing.py \
  -t "./data/fake_images/genCP_HR_RGB_model/test_latest/images" \
  -i "./data/dataset/test" \
  -o "./data/GenCP_DB"
```

Output: 50 georeferenced GeoTIFFs in `data/GenCP_DB/`.

### 2b. Affine correction (Option A — REQUIRED for new outputs)

`gencp_georeferencing.py` declares 10.0 m pixels for content whose true GSD is 10.0390625 m
(geometry-finding.md §5; KARIOS measured the correction to cut the systematic global shift by
40 %). All new chip sets — the Turkish outputs in particular — go through the correction by
default; existing `GenCP_DB` files are left as published:

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/fix_georeferencing.py --dir <output_dir> --out-dir <corrected_dir>
```

Metadata-only (pixels byte-identical); verified against the KARIOS arm-B rasters: 90/90
fixed-then-warped chips byte-identical to the trusted arm B set.

`NotGeoreferencedWarning` is **normal** — the generated PNGs carry no geospatial metadata;
the script takes that information from the input rasters.

### 3. Verification

```python
import rasterio
with rasterio.open('data/GenCP_DB/31TEJ_0451_00.tif') as s:
    print('CRS:', s.crs, '| size:', s.width, 'x', s.height, '| resolution:', s.res)
```

Expected: `CRS: EPSG:32631 | size: 256 x 256 | resolution: (10.0, 10.0)`
(all 50 files were verified to carry these values).

> **This check alone is NOT sufficient.** `gencp_georeferencing.py` copies the `crs` and
> `transform` fields from the reference raster **verbatim**, so all three fields look correct
> even if the wrong PNG was written. For real verification see
> [Verification scripts](#verification-scripts).

> **Known geometry caveat.** The declared 10.0 m pixel size is not exact: inputs are 257×257
> and are resampled to 256×256, so the true ground sample distance is 10.0390625 m — a
> +0.39 % scale error reaching ~14 m at the far corner. Measured and quantified in
> [`docs/geometry-finding.md`](docs/geometry-finding.md). Nothing in the pipeline was changed.

## Verification scripts

### `verify_georeferencing.py`

Closes the gap the CRS/size/resolution check cannot. For every file in `data/GenCP_DB/` it
runs three checks:

1. **Identity** — does the GeoTIFF pixel array match `_fake.png` or `_real.png` exactly?
   The correct answer is `_fake`. A `_real` match is a hard failure (it would mean the input
   image was written instead of the generated one).
2. **Transform** — is the output's affine transform element-by-element identical to that of
   the same-named input raster?
3. **Pairing** — is the filename mapping 1:1, and was any output derived from a
   differently-named input?

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/verify_georeferencing.py
```

Read-only; it writes nothing. Returns a non-zero exit code on failure.
Last run: **50/50 PASS** on all three checks.

### `visualize.py --verify`

The visual counterpart of the identity check above. Produces a three-row grid: row 1 the OSM
input, row 2 the generated `_fake.png`, row 3 the GeoTIFF read back from `GenCP_DB/`.
**Rows 2 and 3 must be pixel-identical**; the script also verifies this by array comparison
and errors out if they differ.

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/visualize.py --verify -n 6 --seed 7
```

Output: `tubitak/outputs/verification_grid.png`. Last run: 6/6 identical.

## Geometry analysis tools

Measurement code behind [`docs/geometry-finding.md`](docs/geometry-finding.md). `shift_estimator.py`
is an importable module, intended for reuse during KARIOS validation:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "tubitak/scripts")
from shift_estimator import phase_shift, ncc_shift, prepare
```

**Always run the self-test before trusting a measurement.** Two estimators are provided because
one is not enough: phase correlation is accurate to 0.076 px RMS *within a modality* but fails
outright across modalities (errors of 40-64 px), where bounded-search NCC is needed instead.

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/shift_estimator.py --self-test
python tubitak/scripts/shift_estimator.py --self-test --mode gradient
```

### `shift_field.py` — shift field between any two rasters

Takes an arbitrary raster pair, so it can be pointed at Turkish AOIs or KARIOS inputs rather than
only the demo. It reports a per-window table, a fitted slope and a plain-language interpretation
(zero field / linear ramp / uniform offset / no clean category), and optionally writes a quiver
figure.

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/shift_field.py REFERENCE.tif MOVING.tif \
    --pixel-size 10 --figure out.png

# cross-modal pairs must use gradient correlation, not intensity
python tubitak/scripts/shift_field.py A.tif B.png --mode gradient
```

### `hypothesis_test.py` — how 257x257 becomes 256x256

Reconstructs each candidate transform and compares it to the network's own recorded input,
printing every candidate's score rather than only the winner.

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/hypothesis_test.py --tiles 8
```

### Alignment: three scripts, one answer

Alignment was measured three ways; the first two are kept because their failures are informative,
and each records the numbers that ruled it out.

| script | compares | bound achieved |
|---|---|---|
| `network_alignment.py` | OSM input vs generated output (cross-modal) | ~0.9 px |
| `paired_alignment.py` | generated output vs **real** satellite half | ~1.9 px (worse) |
| `equivariance_test.py` | two outputs from a **known-offset input** | **0.008 px** |

Both ground-truth comparisons are limited by content mismatch — the generator makes a *plausible*
scene, not the real one. Removing ground truth from the question tightened the bound by two orders
of magnitude.

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/equivariance_test.py \
    --out-p tubitak/data/equivariance/out_p/genCP_HR_RGB_model/test_latest/images \
    --out-q tubitak/data/equivariance/out_q/genCP_HR_RGB_model/test_latest/images --offset 16
```

### `corpus_overlap.py` — is the demo site in the training corpus?

Compares exact chip names, not just MGRS tiles. Answer: the 50 processed chips are all 31TEJ and
appear **nowhere** in the corpus, so demo results are held out.

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/corpus_overlap.py
```

### `receptive_field_check.py` — absolute alignment

Equivariance (0.008 px) does not exclude a *constant* offset. This settles it from the conv/deconv
arithmetic, and includes a random-weight control that shows why the empirical Jacobian probe is
inconclusive below ~1 px.

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/receptive_field_check.py --quiet
```

### `hallucination_analysis.py` — invented structure and chip selection

Measures how much structure the generator invents and whether it degrades local matching. Directly
informs site selection — see [`docs/hallucinated-structure.md`](docs/hallucinated-structure.md).

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/hallucination_analysis.py \
    --figure tubitak/docs/figures/hallucination-analysis.png
```

### `scale_experiment.py` — train/inference scale comparison

Scores the current inference path against the training-matched path on four metrics over two
evaluation grids. See [`docs/train-test-scale-mismatch.md`](docs/train-test-scale-mismatch.md).

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/scale_experiment.py --figure tubitak/docs/figures/scale-comparison.png
```

> **Note on the training set.** `docs/geometry-finding.md` §6 measures `GenCP_HR_DB.zip` (1.71 GB)
> from Zenodo. It is **not** in the repository — it lives in `tubitak/data/`, which is gitignored.
> Re-download it from <https://zenodo.org/records/15044428> if those measurements need repeating.

## KARIOS validation

KARIOS runs in its **own** conda environment (`karios`, Python 3.12 + GDAL 3.8), installed at
`~/tools/karios` — never in `gencp`. See
[`docs/karios-validation.md`](docs/karios-validation.md) for the pre-registered three-arm run.

```bash
conda activate gencp
python tubitak/scripts/build_reference_set.py --out tubitak/data/karios/reference
python tubitak/scripts/build_karios_arms.py

conda activate karios
python tubitak/scripts/run_karios_arms.py --arms A B C

conda activate gencp
python tubitak/scripts/analyse_karios.py --figure tubitak/docs/figures/karios-residuals.png
```

## Visualisation

```bash
python tubitak/scripts/visualize.py --seed 42 -n 4
```

Picks 4 random tiles and writes the OSM input on the top row and the generated image on the
bottom row to `tubitak/outputs/sample_output.png`.

> `tubitak/outputs/` and `tubitak/data/` are covered by `.gitignore`; generated figures do
> not enter the repository, only the scripts are tracked.

## VS Code

Select the `gencp` conda environment as the interpreter:

```
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/envs/gencp/bin/python
```
