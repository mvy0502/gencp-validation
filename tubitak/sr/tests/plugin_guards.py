"""Static guards on `tubitak/sr/sr_plugin`. Runs without QGIS and without Qt.

Three properties are asserted, each of which has already been violated once in this
project or in Project 1:

  G1  No user-facing Turkish literal outside `strings.py`. Project 1's dialog grew Turkish
      inline before `strings.py` existed, and the strings could not then be reviewed or
      changed in one place.
  G2  No forbidden import anywhere in the plugin package: `onnxruntime` (must stay absent
      so the bicubic path loads where it cannot be imported), `pyproj` (segfaults a
      QgsTask worker in QGIS 4.2.1), `multiprocessing` (spawn re-executes the QGIS binary),
      and `gencp_core` (Project 1's core - the two plugins must not couple).
  G3  Every `t()` / `tip()` key used in the package exists in `strings.py`.

Standing practice 11: each guard is born with a failing case, and `--self-test` runs all
three against a known-false fixture BEFORE the real verdict is trusted. Standing practice
10: the guard refuses arguments it does not understand, via `tubitak/tests/_guard.py`.
