"""The registered constants of WP3B, in one place.

Every number `tubitak/sr/docs/03b-registration.md` states is defined HERE and imported.
Nothing restates a constant with a literal. The WP3A constants are NOT redefined: they are
re-exported from `sr_data.params`, so there is exactly one definition of each in the project
and a drift between the corpus and the training run is impossible.

Changing a value here invalidates the registration, not just the code.
