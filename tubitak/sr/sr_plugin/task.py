"""QgsTask wrapper around `sr_core.run.superresolve`.

The work MUST NOT run on the main thread. A full 10980 x 10980 granule is roughly half a
minute of solid CPU; on the GUI thread QGIS stops repainting, macOS shows the spinning
wheel, and users force-quit the application and lose their session. So the whole chain
runs on a QgsTask.

This file contains no super-resolution logic. It forwards to `sr_core.run.superresolve`
and translates its per-tile progress callback into QgsTask's progress and cancellation.

Three traps from Project 1 are paid for here rather than rediscovered:

* **No `pyproj` on this thread.** `pyproj` on a QgsTask worker segfaults QGIS 4.2.1 if and
  only if the main thread built a CRS first. `sr_core` reads CRS through rasterio's own
  PROJ binding and never imports `pyproj`; this module does not import it either, and
  `_pyproj_state()` records what was actually loaded so the claim is observed rather than
  asserted.
* **No `multiprocessing`.** `spawn` re-executes `sys.executable`, which inside QGIS is the
  QGIS application binary, so a pool would launch N copies of QGIS. The work is serial.
* **No `onnxruntime`.** The bicubic path must not import it, so that the plugin loads and
  completes a job on a machine where `onnxruntime` cannot be imported at all - which on
  macOS is the ordinary case inside QGIS's bundled Python, a code-signing split. There is
  no import of it anywhere in this plugin or in `sr_core`.

class SRCancelled(Exception):
    """Raised out of the progress callback to unwind a cancelled run.

    Cancellation is implemented as an exception rather than as a `return False` because
    `sr_core.run.superresolve` takes a progress callback whose return value it ignores -
    a deliberately narrow interface, and one this plugin must not widen, because another
    session is importing that module right now.

    Unwinding through an exception is not a workaround; it is the path that gives the
    required on-disk guarantee. `superresolve` writes inside
    `sr_core.mosaic.atomic_path`, whose `except BaseException` arm unlinks the temporary
    file and leaves the destination exactly as it was. So a cancelled run leaves neither a
    truncated `.tif` at the output path nor a stray `.part` beside it. Returning a flag
    instead would have required `superresolve` to decide what to do with a half-built
    file, which is a decision `atomic_path` already makes correctly.

    exists so the distinction is visible in the log rather than argued about later.
