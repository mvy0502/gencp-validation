"""OSM and land-cover acquisition.

LIFTED VERBATIM from `tubitak/scripts/osm_to_raster.py` (fetch_pbf, fetch, fetch_clcplus,
fetch_worldcover, wc_tiles). The bodies are unchanged: Gate R requires the render to be
byte-identical, and the vector acquisition is half of what the render sees.

Two OSM sources, both returning the same contract — a GeoDataFrame in the working CRS with
the tag columns `rasterize.classify` consumes:

  * `fetch_pbf`  a local, dated .osm.pbf extract. Reproducible, no rate limits, offline.
    Areas come from osmium's area assembler so multipolygon relations survive; note that
    extraction upstream of this must use `osmium extract -s smart`, because the default
    `simple` strategy silently drops boundary-crossing multipolygons (corrections-log
    entry 6).
  * `fetch`      online Overpass via osmnx. Convenient, but rate-limited and undated.

The base land-cover layer is CLC+ Backbone 2021 (local raster, what the upstream renderer
actually used) or ESA WorldCover (remote COGs). Both are read onto the SUPERSAMPLE grid
with nearest-neighbour resampling so their per-pixel speckle survives — the acceptance-test
diagnosis showed the reference composites OSM vectors over a per-pixel land-cover raster.
