"""Extent handling and the tile grid — the geometric spec, shared by every other module.

This module holds the numbers the rest of the chain must agree on, so that `vectors` and
`rasterize` can both depend on them without depending on each other.

The georeferencing correction is the important one. The upstream training chips carry 256
pixels of content spanning 257 x 10 m on the ground (`fix_georeferencing.py` finding), so
the true ground sample distance of a generated tile is 2570/256 = 10.0390625 m, not 10 m.
Placing tiles with a 10.0 m transform puts them progressively wrong. There is no code path
in this package that places a tile with the uncorrected transform.
