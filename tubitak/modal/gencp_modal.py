"""Modal entry point for the seed-replication training runs.

Registration: tubitak/docs/seed-replication-registration.md, AMENDMENT SEED-b.

WHAT THIS CHANGES vs Kaggle, and nothing else:
  * GPU: Modal A10G (Ampere, sm_86) instead of Kaggle T4 (Turing, sm_75). sm_86 IS in the
    pinned torch build's arch list, so no binary-compatibility argument is needed. An L4
    (Ada, sm_89) was the first choice and was superseded before any run: sm_89 is NOT in that
    list. See AMENDMENT SEED-b.
  * TF32 EXPLICITLY DISABLED. The T4 has no TF32 at all, so leaving Ada's TF32 on would move
    convolution and matmul precision as well as hardware, and two factors would vary where we
    intend one. This costs speed and the cost is accepted.
  * Data comes from a Modal Volume instead of /kaggle/input.

WHAT IS HELD IDENTICAL: the image is pinned to the exact versions recovered from the Kaggle
GPU image (AMENDMENT SEED-b), the training script is tubitak/kaggle/train_c1_c2.py unchanged,
the data is byte-identical (same pretrained sha256, same 5,577 pairs), and the sharp-half stop
rule runs exactly as it does on Kaggle because it lives inside that script.
