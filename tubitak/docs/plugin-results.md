## Environment finding (resolved before Step 4, as required)

**QGIS runs here, headless, with working Python bindings.** This was not assumed; it was
tested.

| item | finding |
|---|---|
| QGIS | **4.2.1 "Belém do Pará"**, `/Applications/QGIS-final-4_2_1.app` |
| bundled interpreter | Python **3.12.11** at `Contents/MacOS/python3.12` |
| headless | works via `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` — **no Xvfb needed** (macOS has no X server; Qt's offscreen platform plugin replaces it) |
| CRS / PROJ | works once `PROJ_DATA`/`PROJ_LIB` and `GDAL_DATA` point into `Contents/Resources/qgis/` |
| gotcha | the bundle's interpreter carries a stale build-machine `sys.prefix`; `PYTHONHOME=Contents/Frameworks` is required or it dies with `ModuleNotFoundError: encodings` |

Packages already present **inside QGIS's own Python**: numpy 2.5.0, GDAL 3.12.4,
rasterio 1.5.0, PIL 12.2.0, scipy 1.18.0, shapely 2.1.2, pip 26.1.2. **Missing:
`onnxruntime`** — which is the one thing the plugin must add, and it is a single wheel.

The working command, recorded so it is reproducible:

```bash
A=/Applications/QGIS-final-4_2_1.app/Contents
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen PYTHONHOME=$A/Frameworks \
PYTHONPATH=$A/Resources/python3.12/site-packages:$A/Resources/python \
PROJ_DATA=$A/Resources/qgis/proj PROJ_LIB=$A/Resources/qgis/proj \
GDAL_DATA=$A/Resources/qgis/gdal $A/MacOS/python3.12 -c "import qgis.core"
```

Consequence for reporting: dialog behaviour in this package is **executed**, not merely
written. Where something could not be exercised headlessly it is said so explicitly.

## Gate R — byte-identical raster gate: **PASS (3/3)**

**Predicted:** all three pass; the lift is mechanical.

**Tiles** (registered rule — first three `acc_clcgate` stems with census `byte_exact == 1`,
ascending lexicographic): `30TXQ_0830_00`, `30TXQ_0934_00`, `30UYD_0907_00`.

| tile | core vs stored original | georeferencing | differing px | core vs existing script |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30TXQ_0830_00 | **byte-identical** | transform + CRS equal | 0 / 66,049 | identical |
| 30TXQ_0934_00 | **byte-identical** | transform + CRS equal | 0 / 66,049 | identical |
| 30UYD_0907_00 | **byte-identical** | transform + CRS equal | 0 / 66,049 | identical |

The lift into `gencp_core/rasterize.py` changed nothing. The supporting measurement — the
*existing* `scripts/osm_to_raster.py` run in the same process — is byte-identical to the
core on all three, so the render path is unchanged and the archive is still reproducible
today.

**Disclosed false start.** The first run of this gate failed 0/3 with a dominant
`light_green -> forest_green` flow. Cause: the registration named
`tubitak/data/rasteriser/chips/`, inherited verbatim from
[tool-gate-registration-2.md](tool-gate-registration-2.md); that directory holds the
**WorldCover-era** corpus (18 Aug 19:43), rendered before the CLC+ base layer landed in
`e15f5a9` (19 Aug 11:48). The CLC+ renders the census scored are in
`rasteriser/chips_clc/` (55 files, matching the census's 55 rows). The reference path was
corrected in registration amendment 1; **the criterion, the tile-selection rule and the
byte-identity bar are unchanged.** The lift was exonerated *before* the correction, by the
supporting measurement: the existing script failed identically and core-vs-script was
byte-identical in both runs. The path error is also present in the earlier registration's
text and is flagged there.

---

## Gate O — PyTorch/ONNX parity: **PASS on fp32**, fp16 fails the same bound

**Predicted:** pass; a plain convolutional U-Net exports bit-close in fp32.

**Tiles:** first 20 `acc_clcgate` stems, ascending lexicographic. Both sides deterministic
(dropout removed), BatchNorm in batch-statistics mode.

**Input identity is measured, not assumed:** `gencp_core.infer.preprocess` (plain PIL +
numpy) against the torchvision pipeline `test.py` uses — **max abs diff 0.0, bit-identical**.

### Units (Item A — amendment 2, 2026-08-26)

The first version of this section reported the bound as `0.003922 DN` while the
differences were in DN. **Those were mixed units** — `0.003922 = 1/255` is a
normalised-unit value — and the mismatch left fp16's `0.435565` readable either as
negligible or as catastrophic. Units are now pinned.

**The tensor's value range is `[-1, 1]`** (the generator ends in `Tanh`).
`util.tensor2im` maps it to bytes as `DN = (x + 1) / 2 * 255`, so:

```
1 DN  =  2/255 tensor units (0.007843)  =  1/255 of full scale (0.003922 normalised)
DN    =  |delta_tensor| * 127.5
```

| model | channel | max (DN) | mean (DN) | max (tensor, [-1,1]) | max (normalised, [0,1]) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **fp32** | R | 0.000547 | 0.000034 | 4.292e-06 | 2.146e-06 |
| | G | 0.000471 | 0.000024 | 3.695e-06 | 1.848e-06 |
| | B | 0.000498 | 0.000018 | 3.904e-06 | 1.952e-06 |
| | **overall** | **0.000547** | **0.000025** | **4.292e-06** | **2.146e-06** |
| fp16 | R | 0.435565 | 0.028531 | 3.416e-03 | 1.708e-03 |
| | G | 0.368820 | 0.022284 | 2.893e-03 | 1.446e-03 |
| | B | 0.292493 | 0.023554 | 2.294e-03 | 1.147e-03 |
| | **overall** | **0.435565** | **0.024790** | **3.416e-03** | **1.708e-03** |

The registered bound `1/255`, in every unit, under both readings of the ambiguous text:

| reading | bound | fp32 | fp16 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **strict / literal** — one 255th of a grey level | **0.003922 DN** = 3.076e-05 tensor | **PASS** | **FAIL** |
| loose — one grey level, i.e. 1/255 of full scale | 1.000000 DN = 0.007843 tensor = 0.003922 norm | PASS | PASS |

### The unit-free measurement that decides it

Because the reading is arguable and the units are not, the question was also answered
without any unit convention: **how many pixels of the final uint8 image actually differ**,
over all 20 tiles (1,310,720 pixels):

| model | uint8 pixels differing | max uint8 difference |
|---|---|---|
| **fp32** | **112 / 1,310,720 (0.0085%)** | 1 DN |
| fp16 | **94,992 / 1,310,720 (7.2473%)** | 1 DN |

**Decision confirmed: fp32 ships, fp16 is rejected** — but for a correctly stated reason.
fp16 fails the literal registered bound, and standing practice 6 forbids relaxing a bound
after seeing the outcome. Independently of the wording, fp16 changes **7.25% of the output
bytes against fp32's 0.0085%** — 850x more affected pixels — to save 109 MB out of a
300 MB footprint. That trade is not worth departing from the gated path for.

**Correction to what was reported earlier.** The first report said fp16 "fails the bound by
~110x", which implied a large error. It is not large: fp16 never differs from PyTorch by
more than **1 DN** on any pixel. What is true is that it perturbs 7.25% of output bytes
rather than 0.0085%. The rejection stands; the earlier characterisation of its severity was
wrong.

### The export decision that mattered

`torch.onnx.export` calls `model.eval()` by default. The generator is built with
`--norm batch` and `test.py` never calls `eval()`, so **every number this project has
measured used BatchNorm batch statistics**. Exporting the default way would have switched
it to running statistics — measured on the C3 checkpoint as **mean 32 DN, max 94 DN,
affecting 100% of pixels**. That is a plugin that silently generates different images from
the ones the evaluation phase scored.

At batch size 1, BatchNorm2d in train mode is exactly InstanceNorm2d with the same affine
parameters (**verified: max abs diff 0.0**), so each BatchNorm2d is replaced by that
equivalent before export. The shipped graph reproduces the evaluated path and is
deterministic, because instance statistics depend only on the input.

---

## Item B — the deployed inference configuration

Verified by counting modules in each built generator and nodes in each exported graph, not
by reading the flags.

| Configuration | Dropout | Normalisation | Where its numbers appear |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Measured baseline** (all prior project numbers) | **ON** — 3 × `nn.Dropout(0.5)`, active at test time (`--eval` defaults false and `test.py` never calls `.eval()`) | BatchNorm, **batch statistics** | Every C-phase result, all KARIOS numbers, `tool-results.md`, Registration A `seeded` arm |
| Gate D arm 1 (`seeded`) | **ON**, seed 42 | BatchNorm, batch statistics | Gate D table, `seeded` column (Registration A, recorded) |
| Gate D arm 2 (`det`) | **OFF** — 0 Dropout modules | BatchNorm, batch statistics | Gate D table, `regA det` column; reproduced here as `det_onnx` |
| Gate D arm 3 (`evalbn`) | **OFF** | BatchNorm, **running statistics** | Gate D table, `evalbn` rows |
| **Deployed ONNX model** (`gencp_C3_fp32.onnx`) | **OFF** — 0 `Dropout` nodes in the graph | 13 × `InstanceNormalization`, the exact batch-size-1 equivalent of batch-statistic BatchNorm | Gate O, Gate G, the plugin |

### The deployed model differs from the measured baseline in one cell: dropout

**Deployed has dropout OFF; every number this project has measured had dropout ON.** That
is a real difference and it is stated rather than absorbed.

**It has been measured**, in two links, both with numbers:

1. **Dropout ON → OFF**, at fixed normalisation. This is exactly Registration A: paired
   over 30 production-input Ankara chips, all four arms — pretrained −0.004 ± 0.089,
   C1 −0.040 ± 0.077, C2 −0.021 ± 0.092, C3 −0.028 ± 0.070 px. All inside the registered
   0.05 px indistinguishable band. Stated precision limit: n = 30, SE ≈ 0.077 px rules out
   shifts above roughly 0.15 px, not all shifts.
2. **PyTorch arm 2 → deployed ONNX**, at fixed dropout and normalisation. This is the
   Gate D control: +0.0203 ± 0.0611 px (C3) and +0.0021 ± 0.0194 px (C2), both
   indistinguishable.

So the deployed configuration is two measured steps from the baseline, each within band.

### The claim is narrowed

"The export reproduces the evaluated path" was **too broad** and is withdrawn as stated. It
was established only for **normalisation** — the InstanceNorm substitution is exact
(max abs diff 0.0), so the deployed graph normalises exactly as every measured number did.
It was **not** established for dropout, because the export deliberately removes dropout,
which the baseline had.

The correct claim, which is what the two links above support:

> The exported model reproduces the **tool's deterministic default path** — dropout off,
> batch-statistic normalisation — to within +0.02 px. That path was separately measured
> against the evaluated stochastic baseline and found indistinguishable within the 0.05 px
> band, with the precision limit stated.

Dropout could not have been carried into the export in any case: a delivered tool must
return the same image for the same input, and pix2pix's test-time dropout is the one thing
that prevents it. The choice is disclosed, not hidden — and it was already the tool's
default before this work package (decision of 2026-08-21).

---

## Gate D — determinism

**Registered prediction:** deterministic inference leaves the residual statistically
unchanged (within 0.05 px), and if anything is very slightly better, because disabling the
noise source suppresses invented structure.

**Arms.** (1) seeded stochastic — the evaluated path, from Registration A's committed
per-chip CSV, not re-run. (2) dropout-off, batch-statistics BatchNorm — the current tool
default, also from Registration A. (3) **dropout-off + `--eval` (running-statistics
BatchNorm)** — what this work package asked for, and the arm Registration A deliberately
did not measure. Plus `det_onnx`, a **control**: arm 2 re-run through the new ONNX harness.

30 task3 production-input Ankara chips, arms C3 and C2, KARIOS config unchanged, warp
geometry asserted equal to Registration A's own artifact.

### Control — the harness reproduces the recorded path

| arm | Δ (det_onnx − regA det) | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| C3 | **+0.0203 ± 0.0611 px** (SE 0.0112, n=30) | indistinguishable |
| C2 | **+0.0021 ± 0.0194 px** (SE 0.0035, n=30) | indistinguishable |

The control is what makes the rest of this section quotable, and it earned its place — see
the disclosed error below.

### Results, Δ = candidate − baseline, negative = candidate better

| arm | comparison | Δ (px) | SE | t | band |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C3 | regA det − seeded *(recorded)* | −0.0280 ± 0.3855 | 0.0704 | −0.40 | indistinguishable |
| C3 | **evalbn − seeded** | **−0.0561 ± 0.4607** | 0.0841 | −0.67 | documented difference |
| C3 | evalbn − det (tool default) | −0.0281 ± 0.6332 | 0.1156 | −0.24 | indistinguishable |
| C2 | regA det − seeded *(recorded)* | −0.0210 ± 0.5022 | 0.0917 | −0.23 | indistinguishable |
| C2 | **evalbn − seeded** | **−0.2588 ± 0.4988** | 0.0911 | −2.84 | **materially different** |
| C2 | evalbn − det (tool default) | −0.2378 ± 0.5536 | 0.1011 | −2.35 | **materially different** |

**Verdict against the registered decision rule: eval-mode is NOT worse.** On C3 it is
indistinguishable-to-slightly-better; on C2 it is materially **better** by ~0.24–0.26 px.
The registered rule says that when deterministic is not worse we keep it, so nothing is
referred back to the institution as a penalty decision.

**Caveat that must travel with these numbers — the comparison is not on a common support.**
Point counts differ systematically: median points per chip drop from 60 to 50 (C3) and from
61 to 48 (C2) under eval-mode BatchNorm, about 20% fewer. A median residual computed over a
*smaller, differently selected* point set is not a strictly paired comparison of the same
points, and lower residual over fewer points is exactly what a selection effect would look
like. This project has already established that point-count asymmetry is not benign (the
common-support re-scoring work). **The C2 advantage is therefore reported as measured, and
is not claimed as a proven accuracy gain.**

**What the plugin ships, and why it is the conservative choice.** Both candidates are
deterministic, so determinism does not decide between them. Batch-statistics BatchNorm
**reproduces the evaluated path** (control: +0.002 to +0.020 px) — every number this project
has published applies to it unchanged. Eval-mode BatchNorm is a different output
distribution whose apparent advantage rests on a non-common support. So the plugin
**defaults to batch-statistics BatchNorm**, and the eval-mode model is exported, measured
and available. Following registration D's adoption discipline, a switch of default is
**reported first, not changed in the same step**.

### Disclosed error — the control caught a wrong reference

The first Gate D run used `tubitak/data/ankara/run/arms/<stem>.tif` as the KARIOS
reference. **That directory holds a warped generated arm, not a reference** — it differs
from the warped satellite reference by mean 53.8 DN over 100% of pixels. The control fired
immediately (det_onnx − regA det = **−0.44 px**, materially different), and under that wrong
reference the eval-mode arm looked materially **worse** (+0.42 px on C3, +0.77 px on C2) —
the opposite of the corrected result.

Diagnosis was by elimination, each step ruling out one candidate: the generated images were
byte-equal to Registration A's own warps (max 1 DN); the residual formula reproduced
Registration A's recorded numbers from its own KARIOS output **exactly** (max abs diff
0.0000, point counts equal); the saved KARIOS config was byte-identical to the current one;
the KARIOS install predated Registration A. What remained was the reference, and rebuilding
it the documented way — warping the 257 px satellite reference `ankara/run/ref/<stem>.tif`
onto the same 228 grid, as `build_karios_arms.py` does for its `ref` arm — reproduced
Registration A's recorded value **exactly** (1.940379 px, n = 19 on `ank_0_30`).

Two things follow, and both are recorded rather than tidied away. First, **the sign of this
gate's headline flipped between the wrong and right reference**, so the control was not
ceremony. Second, Registration A's harness was never committed (only its per-chip CSV),
which is why its reference had to be reconstructed by inference at all — an instance of the
class standing practice 22 exists to prevent. The reconstructed harness is committed here
as `tubitak/tests/gate_d_*.py`.
---

## Item C — Gate D on common support: the advantage is mostly survivorship

Registered in [plugin-gate-registration-C.md](plugin-gate-registration-C.md) (`57d25aa`)
before any number below existed. Δ = **evalbn − det_onnx**; negative = evalbn better.
Baseline `det_onnx` = dropout off, **batch**-statistic BatchNorm (deployed). Candidate
`evalbn` = dropout off, **running**-statistic BatchNorm.

Both arms sit on the same 228×228 grid and transform, so KLT `(x0, y0)` are directly
comparable. Points paired by **mutual nearest neighbour, one-to-one, ≤ 1.0 px** (registered
primary), chips with fewer than 5 pairs excluded.

### Primary result — the effect shrinks by ~79% on common support

| arm | Δ on FULL sets | Δ on COMMON set | chips | n_common (median / total) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C3** | −0.2824 ± 0.4240 px (SE 0.0999, t=−2.83) **material** | **−0.0594 ± 0.1500 px** (SE 0.0354, **t=−1.68**) *documented difference* | 18/30 | 14 / 625 |
| **C2** | −0.1861 ± 0.4836 px (SE 0.1081, t=−1.72) **material** | **−0.0396 ± 0.1444 px** (SE 0.0323, **t=−1.23**) **indistinguishable** | 20/30 | 13 / 721 |

**The registered primary prediction is confirmed.** `|Δ|` shrank on common support in both
arms and at every tolerance — about **79% of the apparent advantage disappears** once both
arms are scored on the same points. C2 falls inside the 0.05 px indistinguishable band;
C3 lands at −0.059 px, outside 0.05 but far inside 0.15, and not significant (t = −1.68).

**Sensitivity — the conclusion does not depend on the tolerance:**

| tolerance | C3 Δ common | C2 Δ common |
|---|---|---|
| 0.5 px | −0.0641 (t=−1.86) | −0.0396 (t=−1.23) |
| **1.0 px (registered)** | **−0.0594 (t=−1.68)** | **−0.0396 (t=−1.23)** |
| 2.0 px | −0.0529 (t=−1.41) | −0.0313 (t=−0.96) |

### Secondary result — the mechanism is measured directly, and it is large

The registered secondary prediction: the points eval-mode **drops** should be the harder
ones. Measured in the baseline arm only, so it needs no pairing:

| arm | median error of DROPPED points | median error of SURVIVING points | paired difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| C3 | **1.4513 px** | 0.5576 px | **+1.0054 ± 0.7058 px** (SE 0.1664, **t=+6.04**, n=18) |
| C2 | **1.6530 px** | 0.5067 px | **+0.9008 ± 0.7190 px** (SE 0.1608, **t=+5.60**, n=20) |

The points that eval-mode's smoother images fail to produce are the ones carrying roughly
**1 px more error**, at t > 5.6 in both arms. That is the survivorship mechanism, measured
rather than inferred.

### Decision

**The advantage does not survive on common support, so the registered rule applies: the
plugin keeps batch-statistic normalisation and eval-mode is not adopted.** That is what is
already deployed, so nothing changes in the shipped model — but it is now decided on
evidence rather than on the conservative default.

### What this changes in what we reported before

Gate D's headline — *"on C2 it is materially better by ~0.24–0.26 px"* — **does not
survive**. It was reported with an explicit caveat that the comparison was not on common
support; that caveat is now discharged, and it was the right one. The revised statement:

> Eval-mode BatchNorm is **not worse** than the deployed path, and its apparent advantage
> is **mostly survivorship**: about 79% of it disappears when both arms are scored on the
> same points, and the points it drops carry ~1 px more error at t > 5.6.

The other Gate D conclusion — that eval-mode is not *worse*, so determinism costs nothing —
is unaffected.

### Limitation, stated

Matching at 1 px is strict, because each arm's keypoints are detected independently on
different images: only about **14 of ~66** points per chip pair up, and 10–12 chips of 30
fall below the 5-pair floor and are excluded. The common set is therefore itself a
selected population — the stable, easy points, where both arms score ~0.50–0.56 px against
~1.14 px on the full sets. So this test has **reduced power to detect a real difference on
hard points**; it establishes that the *observed* advantage is largely survivorship, not
that no real difference could exist anywhere. The secondary measurement is the more robust
of the two, because it needs no pairing and its effect is an order of magnitude clearer.

---

## Item D — registration audit

Findings only. Nothing is retracted or amended here; what *would* need retracting is listed
at the end for the institution to decide.

### D1 — `tool-gate-registration-2` names the wrong corpus directory: **text only, numbers are sound**

The registration says the reference renders are `tubitak/data/rasteriser/chips/<stem>.tif`.
That path holds the **WorldCover-era** corpus. The CLC+ renders are in `chips_clc/`.

**The numbers ran on the correct corpus.** Evidence, measured rather than argued: the
current renderer's output is byte-identical to `chips_clc/` and **differs** from `chips/`
for every tested stem, while the committed census records `byte_exact = 1` for exactly
those stems.

| stem | census `byte_exact` | vs `chips/` | vs `chips_clc/` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30TXQ_0830_00 | 1 | differs | **identical** |
| 30TXQ_0934_00 | 1 | differs | **identical** |
| 30UYD_0907_00 | 1 | differs | **identical** |

A census that scored `byte_exact = 1` cannot have been comparing against `chips/`, because
nothing the renderer produces matches `chips/`. Two further confirmations: the census has
**55 rows** and `chips_clc/` holds **55 files**; and the registration's own sentence reads
"257 px, **CLC+ base**" — the description is correct and only the path string is wrong.

**Verdict: a text slip, not a data error. No retraction is warranted; a text correction is.**

### D2 — the generated-arm-as-reference substitution: **it does not appear in any prior gate**

The canonical Ankara KARIOS reference is `tubitak/data/ankara/run/ref/<stem>_warp.tif`
(130 files) — a warped satellite reference that was there all along. My first Gate D run
used `ankara/run/arms/<stem>.tif` instead, which is a warped **generated arm**. I did not
find the `_warp` variant sitting in the same directory as the 257 px chips.

Reference directory used by every KARIOS-scoring package, read from each run's own
`correl_res.txt` and from the harnesses:

| package(s) | reference used | class |
|---|---|---|
| `ankara/run`, `task3`, `regA`, `regB`, `regC`, `regD`, `B2`, `C45` + all seed variants | `ankara/run/ref/<stem>_warp.tif` | **warped satellite** |
| European corpus (`karios/arms/ref/`, `karios/ceiling`) | built by `build_karios_arms.py` from `karios/reference/satellite/` | **warped satellite** |
| Gate D, first run **(this package, my error)** | `ankara/run/arms/<stem>.tif` | **generated arm — wrong** |
| Gate D, corrected | rebuilt warped satellite | warped satellite |

Both reference families were verified by reconstruction, not by reading paths:

- `ankara/run/ref/ank_13_34_warp.tif` is **byte-identical** (max abs diff 0) to a warped
  satellite reference rebuilt independently from `ankara/run/ref/ank_13_34.tif`.
- `karios/arms/ref/32UMA_1685_00.tif` is **byte-identical** (max abs diff 0) to the same
  reconstruction from `karios/reference/satellite/`.

**Verdict: no prior gate used a generated arm as its reference. The substitution was mine
alone, confined to the first Gate D run, and the control caught it. Nothing to retract.**

### D3 — Registration A's uncommitted harness: what is and is not reproducible

The harness script was never committed. What *was* preserved turns out to be more than
expected: each arm's `log_*.txt` carries the **full option dump**, so the configuration is
on the record even though the orchestration is not.

| | recorded | not recorded |
|---|---|---|
| `det` arm | `no_dropout: True`, `eval: False`, dataroot, checkpoints_dir, `num_test: 30` | — |
| `seeded` arm | `no_dropout: False`, `eval: False`, same paths | **the seed value**; **the torch version/build** |

**Exactly reproducible today:** the `det` (dropout-off) arm. Re-run end to end it
reproduces Registration A's recorded value **exactly** — `ank_0_30` det C3: 1.940379 px,
n = 19, against 1.940379 px, n = 19 recorded; and the regenerated warp rasters match
regA's own to a max of 1 DN.

**Not exactly reproducible:** the `seeded` stochastic arm, for two independent reasons.
The seed value appears nowhere in the run record (it was applied through a `sitecustomize`
shim outside the options system; seed 42 is known only from the registration prose), and no
torch version or build is recorded — so even with the seed, the RNG stream is not
guaranteed to match across torch builds or platforms.

**Closest reproducible substitute, verified by measurement:** the archived fakes and warps
themselves. `regA/seeded_*/warp/*.tif` are on disk (16 arm directories, 91 files each, plus
300+ KARIOS files per cell). Re-scoring the archived seeded fake for `ank_0_30` against the
now-verified reference reproduces the recorded number **exactly**: 2.276977 px, n = 29,
against 2.276977 px, n = 29. So every Registration A number remains auditable from
artifacts, even though the stochastic arm cannot be regenerated from scratch.

### D4 — an unlisted finding: the split broke two live harness dependencies

Not asked for, found while running D3. Commit `b815b46` deleted two files the **active**
Gate D harness reads:

- `tubitak/configs/karios_gencp.json` — every KARIOS invocation passes it as `--conf`;
  without it `karios process` exits with "File does not exist".
- `tubitak/docs/evidence/regA/regA_per_chip.csv` — `gate_d_analyse.py` reads it as the
  baseline for the control.

Both are the same class as the exceptions the split already made for
`plugin-gate-registrations.md` and `osm_to_raster.py`: files that live work in this
repository depends on. Both are restored here, and every path referenced by
`tubitak/tests/` and `tubitak/gencp_core/` now resolves. Gate D's analysis reproduces its
recorded control (+0.0203 / +0.0021 px) after the restore.

### What would need retracting, if anything

**Nothing.** D1 is a text slip over sound numbers; D2 found no prior contamination; D3
found the record auditable. The two items for the institution to decide are both text or
policy, not results:

1. Correct the corpus path in `tool-gate-registration-2.md` — `chips/` → `chips_clc/` —
   as a disclosed text correction with the original preserved, per standing practice 4.
2. Decide whether the boundary rule for `gencp-validation` should be stated as a **class**
   ("anything an active harness in this repository reads stays here") rather than an
   enumerated list, since the enumeration has now missed two files.

## Item E — toolkit-version-agnostic plugin

### Qt imports: already through the shim, and verified

**No direct `PyQt5.*` or `PyQt6.*` import exists anywhere** in `qgis_plugin/`,
`gencp_core/` or `tubitak/tests/`. All eight Qt import sites go through `qgis.PyQt.*`,
which resolves to whichever Qt the host QGIS was built against.

Verified inside the running QGIS process (Qt **6.11.1**, PyQt **6.11.0**):

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `QAction` importable from `qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets` | **True** — the shim back-fills it on Qt6, where Qt moved it to `QtGui` |
| `QAction` importable from `qgis.PyQt.QtGui` | True |
| `qgis_plugin.plugin` imports cleanly | OK |
| `member(Qt, 'AlignCenter')` | `AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter` |
| `member(Qt, 'KeepAspectRatio')` | `AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio` |
| `member(Qgis, 'Critical')` | `MessageLevel.Critical` |
| `member(QgsTask, 'CanCancel')` | `Flag.CanCancel` |
| `member(QgsMapLayerProxyModel, 'All')` | `LayerFilter.All` |

`QAction` was the one real hazard: Qt6 moved it out of `QtWidgets`, and `plugin.py` imports
it from there. The QGIS shim covers it, so no change was needed — but it was **tested, not
assumed**, because the headless suite constructs the dialog directly and never exercises
`initGui()`.

### API the shim does not cover: audited, none present

Searched for the usual Qt5-only survivors — `exec_()`, `QDesktopWidget`, `QRegExp`,
`AA_EnableHighDpiScaling`, `QVariant(...)`, `QStringList`, `setResizeMode`, `toAscii`,
`QTextCodec`. **None appears in the plugin.**

The QGIS API surface used is small and long-standing (all QGIS 3.0-era):
`QgsApplication`, `QgsMapLayerComboBox`, `QgsMapLayerProxyModel`, `QgsMessageLog`,
`QgsProject`, `QgsRasterLayer`, `QgsTask`, and `iface.{addPluginToRasterMenu,
addToolBarIcon, mainWindow, messageBar, removePluginRasterMenu, removeToolBarIcon}`.

### `qgisMinimumVersion`: set honestly, with the gap stated

`qgisMinimumVersion=3.28`, plus `qgisMaximumVersion=4.99` and `supportsQt6=True`.

**3.28 is reasoned about, not tested. I could not verify a 3.x load — no QGIS 3.x is
installed on this machine.** What supports the claim is that every Qt access goes through
the shim, no Qt5-only or Qt6-only API is used, and the QGIS API surface predates 3.28
entirely. What would refute it is a single 3.x load, which has not happened. That sentence
is in `metadata.txt`'s `about` field so it travels with the plugin rather than living only
in this report.

### Windows: one real bug, fixed

| finding | status |
|---|---|
| `pipeline.py` built its work directory from `os.environ["TMPDIR"]` with a `"/tmp"` fallback | **Fixed** — now `tempfile.gettempdir()`, which honours `TMPDIR` on POSIX and `TEMP`/`TMP` on Windows. The old code would have produced a non-existent absolute path on Windows. |
| any other `/tmp`, `/usr/`, `os.system`, or shell invocation in `gencp_core/` or `qgis_plugin/` | **none** |
| string-concatenated paths with forward slashes | **none** — all path building is `pathlib` |
| `run_in_qgis.sh` is bash and macOS-specific | **test helper only, not shipped**; noted rather than fixed, since the equivalent on Windows is a different invocation of the same app binary |
| `osmium` / `onnxruntime` availability on Windows | both publish Windows wheels; **not verified here** |

### Re-verified after the changes

The full headless suite still passes **25/25** in QGIS 4.2.1 after the `tempfile` change
and the metadata edit.

### Also corrected

`metadata.txt`'s `tracker` and `repository` pointed at `gencp-validation`, which the new
repository rules make a destination rather than a workspace. Both now point at
`mvy0502/GenCP`.

## Gate G — georeferencing contract: **PASS (12/12)**

Reference layer `ank_0_30.tif`, EPSG:32636, extent
`(399960.0, 4420330.0, 402530.0, 4422900.0)`. Numbers, not "passed":

### A. Grid alignment

| assertion | measured | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| output CRS == reference CRS | EPSG:32636 == EPSG:32636 | PASS |
| pixel size == 10.0 m, both axes | x = `10.0`, y = `10.0` (exact float equality) | PASS |
| NW corner == reference NW corner | origin offset **x 0.0 m, y 0.0 m** (0.0 px, 0.0 px) | PASS |
| size == ceil(span / GSD) | 257 × 257, expected 257 × 257 (span 2570.0 × 2570.0 m) | PASS |
| E/S overhang within one pixel | east **0.000000 m**, south **0.000000 m** (rule permits [0, 10)) | PASS |
| transform term by term | `(10.0, 0.0, 399960.0, 0.0, -10.0, 4422900.0)` both | PASS |
| grid is an integer offset of the reference grid | fractional part **x 0.0, y 0.0** | PASS |

### B. Content placement (sub-pixel)

| assertion | measured | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| mosaic == independent corrected-affine warp | max abs difference **0.497043 DN** (uint8 rounding allows 1) | PASS |
| cross-correlation integer peak | lag (dy, dx) = **(0, 0)** over 56,169 px | PASS |
| sub-pixel refined peak within 0.05 px | **dy = +0.000181 px, dx = −0.000013 px** = **+1.8 mm, −0.1 mm** | PASS |

**The snapping rule, restated because the downstream consumer depends on it.** The grid is
anchored at the reference extent's **north-west corner exactly** — not snapped to a multiple
of the GSD — and grows east and south in whole 10 m pixels, so
`width = ceil((xmax−xmin)/10)`, `height = ceil((ymax−ymin)/10)`, transform
`(10.0, 0, xmin_ref, 0, −10.0, ymax_ref)`. The east and south edges may extend up to one
pixel beyond the requested extent. This is embedded verbatim in every output's
`GENCP_PROVENANCE` tag alongside the model SHA-256, the inference path and the corrected
GSD 10.0390625 — 17 fields, so a consumer that finds a GCP wrong can tell exactly what
produced the raster.

**What this gate deliberately does not test.** It does not correlate the synthetic output
against real satellite imagery. How well generated imagery matches a real scene is a
scientific question, already measured by KARIOS at a median residual of roughly 1.9 px, and
it is **not** a georeferencing defect. Mixing the two would have made a georeferencing gate
that fails for reasons unrelated to georeferencing, so content placement is checked against
an independently computed warp of the same generated tile.

## Gate S — size table (measured on disk, no estimates)

**Test area:** `(399960.0, 4390200.0, 509760.0, 4500000.0)` in EPSG:32636 —
109.8 km × 109.8 km = **12,056 km²**, stated so the normalisation is checkable.

| item | MB | MB per 1000 km² |
|---|---:|---:|
| ONNX model, fp32 **(deployed)** | **217.68** | n/a |
| ONNX model, fp16 (not deployed — fails Gate O) | 108.86 | n/a |
| `onnxruntime` installed footprint | 82.72 | n/a |
| OSM subset, `.osm.pbf` cut with `-s smart` | 23.41 | **1.94** |
| CLC+ clip, deflate GeoTIFF | 16.22 | **1.35** |

**Fixed cost, independent of coverage: 300.4 MB** (fp32 model + onnxruntime).
**Per-area data: 3.3 MB per 1000 km².**

| coverage | total |
|---|---|
| the 12,056 km² test area | **340 MB** |
| Ankara province (~25,600 km²) | 385 MB |
| all of Turkey (~783,600 km²) | 2,877 MB |

Two things this table does *not* say, stated so the number is not misread:

- The CLC+ row is the size of a **clip for the area**, not of the 8.2 GB continental CLC+
  Backbone source. The plugin window-reads that source and never ships it. **CLC+ Backbone
  covers Europe only**, which matters for any Turkish coverage east of its extent.
- Data is measured **in the format the plugin actually consumes** — a `-s smart` `.osm.pbf`
  and a windowed CLC+ clip — not as an intermediate or a database export.

**Short answer for Mustafa Bey:** about **300 MB fixed** (model plus runtime), plus roughly
**3.3 MB per 1000 km²** of coverage. Ankara province lands near 385 MB; the whole of Turkey
would be about 2.9 GB.

## Step 4 — plugin shell: built and **executed** in real QGIS (25/25 checks)

Because headless QGIS works here, the dialog was **run**, not just written. The harness
(`tubitak/tests/test_plugin_headless.py`, driven by `tubitak/tests/run_in_qgis.sh`)
constructs the real `QDialog`, drives the real widgets and runs a real `QgsTask` through
the real task manager inside QGIS 4.2.1.

| section | check | result |
|---|---|---|
| — | `gencp_core` imports inside QGIS's Python | PASS |
| — | **PyTorch is not required** inside QGIS | PASS |
| — | onnxruntime available | PASS (1.29.0) |
| 1 Input | reads and displays extent, CRS, tile count and a time estimate | PASS (extent, `EPSG:32636 — WGS 84 / UTM zone 36N`, 2 tiles) |
| 2 Data source | **blocks** until the source is resolved; unblocks when it is | PASS (both directions) |
| 3 Preview | renders the rasterised input on screen | PASS (384 px, 5.5 s) |
| 3 Preview | not reduced to a thumbnail | PASS (384 px) |
| 3 Preview | **generation does not start until the user confirms** | PASS (Run stays disabled with everything else filled in) |
| 4 Model | shows model file name and modification date | PASS (`gencp_C3_fp32.onnx`, modified 2026-08-26 16:27:01) |
| 5 Run | **inference runs OFF the main thread** | **PASS** (verified on the QgsTask worker thread) |
| 5 Run | progress bar advances | PASS |
| 5 Run | cancel stops the task | PASS |
| 6 Output | writes a GeoTIFF to the chosen path | PASS |
| 6 Output | adds the result to the map as a layer | PASS |

**25/25.** The two hard requirements — inference off the main thread, and Preview as a real
gate on generation rather than decoration — are both verified by execution.

The dialog holds no generation logic: every numeric or geometric decision is delegated to
`gencp_core` (`extent` for extents and tile grids, `rasterize` for rendering, `pipeline`
for the run).

### Deployment findings worth carrying forward

1. **macOS code signing splits the two interpreters.** The QGIS **application** executable
   is signed with `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`; the bundled
   **`python3.12`** executable is **not**. Under the hardened runtime, onnxruntime's and
   pyosmium's native extensions load normally in the QGIS process the plugin runs in, and
   are refused in `python3.12` with *"different Team IDs"*. Testing through `python3.12`
   reports a failure that does not exist in deployment. `run_in_qgis.sh` drives the app
   binary for this reason.
2. **Dependencies QGIS does not already have:** `onnxruntime` (required) and `osmium`
   (only for the local `.osm.pbf` source); `osmnx` only for Overpass. Everything else the
   chain needs — numpy, GDAL, rasterio, PIL, scipy, shapely, geopandas, pyproj — already
   ships inside QGIS 4.2.1.
3. **QGIS 4 is PyQt6, QGIS 3 is PyQt5**, and Qt6 removed the flat enum names
   (`Qt.AlignCenter` → `Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter`). `qgis_plugin/qtcompat.py` resolves
   enum members either way so the plugin runs on both.
