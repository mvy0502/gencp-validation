# phase-c and phase-c-lpips registration audit — both halves of the letter's Table I

Date: 2026-08-24. Work item 1 of [paper-roadmap.md](paper-roadmap.md), continuing after
[T1-audit.md](T1-audit.md) and [B2-B3-audit.md](B2-B3-audit.md). Method and structure are
theirs: commit timestamps against artifact mtimes, run configuration diffed against the
registration *text*, and a full recomputation of every reported cell from raw outputs.

Two registrations, audited together because the letter's primary table needs both:

- **[phase-c-lpips-registration.md](phase-c-lpips-registration.md)** (`b07e719`) — the 2×2
  loss factorial, behind the paper's primary result C5 − C4 = −0.487 ± 0.053 px.
- **[phase-c-registration.md](phase-c-registration.md)** (`d621549`) — the C1/C2 arms, whose
  C2 − C1 = −0.638 ± 0.054 px is the Gate-1 comparison target the whole C4/C5 package is
  registered against.

The C4/C5 harness is committed (`tubitak/scripts/c45_eval/`, `40cde9b`), so B3's entry-22
failure mode cannot apply to it. That was the reason to expect a clean result — and it is
why the deviations found below carry more weight than B3's did.

**Verdict in one line: phase-c-lpips passes legs A and B and fails leg C on one registered
stop rule; phase-c passes leg A, fails leg B for the C1/C2 arms because their raw layer no
longer exists, and passes leg C.** Neither failure changes a conclusion. Details in the
per-registration verdicts.

**Classification: zero files predate the registration commit.** All 18,819 files under
`tool_runs/C45/` were written between 2026-08-24 02:35:57 and 03:05:04 — that is, between
3 h 48 m and 4 h 18 m *after* `b07e719`. There is no input, no checkpoint and no computed
score in the package that predates registration. Nothing postdates the results commit
either.

**Elapsed wall time, so no window is asserted rather than explained.** Training: C4
**3 h 28 m** (12,486.8 s), C5 **3 h 33 m** (12,835.9 s), measured from the Kaggle log's own
elapsed-time field, against the ≈ 3 h 25 m / ≈ 3 h 40 m documented in
[phase-c-lpips-results.md](phase-c-lpips-results.md) — C4 agrees to 3 minutes, C5 is 7
minutes shorter than stated. Both figures are written with "≈"; the exact values are
recorded here so the approximation is not the only record. The two arms ran **concurrently**
in separate Kaggle sessions (preflights 2 s apart), which is why ~3.5 h of training fits
between 22:51 and 02:24. Local evaluation: **29 min 07 s** end to end (02:35:57 → 03:05:04),
of which the five-arm panel took 18 min and the epoch sweep the remaining 11. The tightest
interval in the chain is `C45_sweep_summary.json` at 03:05:04 against the results commit at
03:05:33 — **29 seconds** — correctly ordered, and the sweep is the last thing the results
document needed.

**One item the timeline places precisely.** The eval harness was committed at 02:44:06,
which is *after* the C45 staging directory appears (02:35:57) but *before* every inference,
warp, KARIOS run and derived number (02:52:34 onward). The harness that produced every
reported cell was therefore in version control before it produced any of them.

**Classification.** Five artifacts predate the registration commit, all of them
**inputs or baseline**: `turkey_karios.csv` (the published Phase B pretrained per-chip
medians, which the registration treats as the baseline to beat), `clc_scores.csv` (the
stratum labels), and the `ankara/run/` input/reference/pretrained-output tree. **No C1 or C2
artifact of any kind predates the registration** — neither arm had been trained; the first
line of C1's run is 3 h 19 m after the registration commit. The claim holds.

Elapsed: C1 **1 h 15 m**, C2 **1 h 16 m**, concurrent (preflights 31 min apart, both
finished by ~17:35). Local scoring occupied the evening; the results commit is 6 h 11 m
after the last training run ended. The window is comfortable and needs no further
explanation — unlike the headline package's 26 minutes.

## B. Reported cells versus raw outputs

### B.1 phase-c-lpips — PASS on every cell that has an artifact, with three transcription
defects and one unreproducible column

**Five-arm ank130 panel** (`C45_per_chip.csv` rebuilt from the 260 raw KARIOS KLT files for
C4/C5 plus `B1_per_chip.csv` for pretrained/C1/C2, under the harness's documented formula:
per-chip statistic = median `hypot(dx, dy)`; per-arm = mean/median of the 130 per-chip
medians):

- **1,300/1,300 per-chip cells reproduce exactly** against the committed
  `C45_per_chip.csv`. Zero mismatches.
- **25/25 per-arm summary cells reproduce** against `C45_summary.json` (5 arms ×
  {mean, SE, median, points-median, zero-point count}).
- **30/30 paired cells reproduce** (6 deltas × {mean, SE, t, n, chips-first-better}):
  C5 − C4 **−0.4871 ± 0.0531**, t = −9.18, 113/130; C2 − C1 −0.6995 ± 0.0592, 116/130;
  C4 − C1 −0.1098 ± 0.0580; C5 − C2 +0.1025 ± 0.0416; C4 − pre −0.5972 ± 0.0606;
  C5 − pre −1.0844 ± 0.0714.
- **Interaction reproduces**: D_L1 = +0.6995 ± 0.0592, D_LPIPS = +0.4871 ± 0.0531,
  I = **−0.2123 ± 0.0691, t = −3.07**. Band: I negative at ≥ 2 SE with D_LPIPS positive at
  ≥ 2 SE → *substitutes*, as reported.
  **Forward pointer added 2026-08-26 — this verdict is unchanged and stands.** It is a
  reproducibility finding about a seed-42 computation and it is still true: the quantity
  reproduces from raw, exactly as audited. What happened later is separate and does not
  reach back into this cell — the seed-level reading built on that quantity **failed at
  n = 6** (5/6, seed 46 positive on all three registered scales), and the pre-committed
  consequence withdrew the interaction claim and the *substitutes* language from the paper.
  See [seed-block-results.md](seed-block-results.md) §4. **A number can reproduce perfectly
  and still not support the claim that was built on it**; that is precisely the distinction
  this audit's leg-B/leg-C split exists to preserve.
- **Dose-response sweep reproduces, 25/25 cells** (5 epochs × {C4 mean, C5 mean, penalty,
  SE, t}), including the endpoint claims: C5 improves e1 → e20 at **4.25 SE**, C4 flat at
  **0.24 SE**. Both match to two decimals.
- **Edge-ratio table reproduces, 20/20 cells** including the q25–q75 columns
  (pretrained 0.943–1.121, C1 0.959–1.174, C2 0.120–0.382, C4 0.997–1.204, C5 1.032–1.271).
- **Registered bands independently re-evaluated from raw:** primary fires at 9.18 SE; null 2
  fires at 2.46 SE; retraction condition not triggered — **5 of 6 fine-tuned pairs at
  ≥ 2 SE**, the exception being C1–C4 at 1.89 SE, exactly as the results document states.

**The "reproduces the committed headline figures to the fourth digit" claim — VERIFIED,
and it is true of the means only.** The four existing arms' 20-chip production means
recomputed through the C45 harness are pretrained 1.369802, C1 0.764049, C2 0.592721,
C3 0.610947, against `B2_summary.json`'s committed 1.3698 / 0.7640 / 0.5927 / 0.6109 —
**identical to four decimal places, 4/4**. The extension is validated as claimed.

**Defect 1 — the secondary table's SE column does not come from the artifact and cannot be
reproduced.** `C45_b2_summary.json` stores SEs of 0.1612 / 0.0712 / 0.0409 / 0.0375 /
0.0949 / 0.0660 for pretrained / C1 / C2 / C3 / C4 / C5, which is exactly what
`sd/√20` gives and exactly what B2 committed for the four existing arms. The results
document's secondary table prints **1.370 ± 0.108, 0.764 ± 0.043, 0.593 ± 0.041,
0.611 ± 0.043, 0.844 ± 0.054, 0.663 ± 0.045** — **five of six disagree with the artifact**,
only C2's 0.041 matching. The five values are not the SE of the mean, the SE of the median
(1.2533·sd/√n), a bootstrap median SE (4,000 resamples), a MAD-based SE, or an IQR-based
SE; they are not the RGB-band SEs either; and they appear nowhere else in the repository.
**They have no traceable origin.** → **corrections-log entry 24**.

The defect is confined to that column. Every mean, median, point count and paired delta in
the same table reproduces exactly, the ordering C2 < C3 < C5 < C1 < C4 < pretrained is
correct, and the paired C5 − C4 = −0.1817 ± 0.0541 (t = −3.36, 16/20) — the sentence the
row exists to support — is right. Because the row is explicitly secondary and carries no
registered band, no verdict depends on the wrong column.

**Defect 2 — two double-rounded cells in the primary tables.** Twenty reported 3-decimal
values were re-derived from raw and compared against correct half-up rounding:
**18/20 correct, 2 wrong by +0.001**, both from transcribing the artifact's 4-decimal value
and rounding a second time.

| cell | raw value | correct 3 dp | results document |
|---|---|---|---|
| C4 ank130 mean | 1.965452 | **1.965** | 1.966 |
| C1 edge-ratio mean | 1.096463 | **1.096** | 1.097 |

Both appear in tables destined for the letter. Neither changes a band: C4's mean is not a
band quantity, and C1's edge ratio clears the "near 1.0 ≥ 0.8" threshold either way.
→ folded into **entry 24**.

**Defect 3 — half-integer point-count medians printed as integers, in both packages.** With
an even number of chips the median point count can be a half-integer; the harness prints it
with `:.0f`, which rounds to even, and the documents carry the rounded value with no note.
Systematic and explicable. **Enumerated here and deliberately not corrected**, because how
they should be stated depends on a decision the audit should not make alone — see below.
→ folded into **entry 24**.

**Complete list of half-integer point-count medians, 2026-08-24.** Every point-count median
in every artifact behind a reported table was checked; ten are half-integers, six of them in
a printed table:

| document | table | arm | artifact value | as printed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| phase-c-lpips-results.md | ank130 primary panel | C4 | **61.5** | 62 |
| phase-c-lpips-results.md | 20-chip secondary | C1 | **163.5** | 164 |
| phase-c-lpips-results.md | 20-chip secondary | C4 | **155.5** | 156 |
| phase-c-lpips-results.md | 20-chip secondary | C5 | **224.5** | **224** (down) |
| phase-c-results.md | pretrained per-stratum | Q2 | **37.5** | 38 |
| phase-c-results.md | pretrained per-stratum | Q3 | **51.5** | 52 |
| — artifact only, not printed anywhere — | | | | |
| headline-results.md B2 (BT.601) | — | C1 | 163.5 | not printed |
| headline-results.md B2 (RGB) | — | pretrained / C1 / C3 | 78.5 / 136.5 / 181.5 | not printed |
| B1 | — | C1_e10 / C2_e10 | 62.5 / 72.5 | not printed |

C5 rounds down while C1 and C4 round up because `:.0f` rounds half to even; it is consistent,
not erratic.

**The load-bearing argument is unaffected, and this is the reason not to touch these
blind.** The point-count claim the paper leans on — *"C5 produces more surviving matches than
C2 (median 88 vs 72) and still scores worse"*, the sentence that closes the fewer-but-better
reviewer objection — rests on the ank130 panel, where **both values are exact integers**
(C5 88.0, C2 72.0). No half-integer enters it. The same panel's C4 (61.5) is not part of that
comparison. So the decision about how to state half-integers is a presentational one that can
be taken deliberately — print one decimal, or note the convention once — without any risk to
the argument, which is why it is listed rather than silently rewritten.

**Training-curve prose, checked against the per-epoch log means:** C4's main stage
54.37 → 55.73 = **+2.50%** ✓, 54.37 **is** the run minimum ✓, warm-up epoch 1 = 56.24 ✓,
C1's G_L1 wiggle band 32.82–34.33 ✓ ("32.8–34.3"). One inaccuracy: C5's G_LPIPS is
described as a "**monotone decrease** 53.0 → 49.0"; the endpoints are right (53.01 → 49.01)
but the series is **not monotone** — it rises at five epoch transitions (e11→12, e12→13,
e14→15, e16→17, e17→18), each by ≤ 0.22. The contrast being drawn (C5 falls, C4 drifts up)
survives; the word does not. Disclosed here, not corrected.

**Available but unscored, no deviation:** the C4/C5 KARIOS runs also produced the **RGB**
band on the 20-chip subset (40 runs, `B2/karios/rgb/C{4,5}/`), which no summary scores.
The registration fixes BT.601 for this row in its invariance section, so RGB is unregistered
and its absence is *not* the entry-19 pattern. Recorded here because the data exists and
corroborates: C4 0.9768 ± 0.1351, C5 0.6606 ± 0.0566, **C5 − C4 = −0.3161 ± 0.1044
(t = −3.03, 20/20 chips)** — a larger and cleaner main effect than BT.601's, same ordering.

### B.2 phase-c — FAIL for the C1/C2 arms: the raw layer no longer exists

**The pretrained row reproduces.** `ankara/turkey_karios.csv` (mtime 2026-08-19 11:52:20)
carries the per-chip median and point count for all 130 chips plus the stratum label.
Recomputed against the reported table: **10/12 cells exact** (5 strata + ALL, × {median,
points}), the two exceptions being the Q2/Q3 half-integer point counts of Defect 3. Medians
Q1 3.4798, Q2 3.1060, Q3 2.4922, Q4 2.0843, Q5 1.2404, ALL 2.5877 — all correct to the
reported 3 decimals.

**The C1 and C2 rows cannot be recomputed at all.** No per-chip artifact from the
2026-08-19/20 phase-C scoring run survives anywhere: the earliest directory under
`tool_runs/` is dated 2026-08-20 19:32, the `ankara/run/` tree holds only the pretrained
arm's outputs (`out/genCP_HR_RGB_model`), and `turkey_karios.csv` has no C1 or C2 column.
Every reported C1/C2 cell — the ten per-stratum values, the two ALL values, all three paired
deltas including **C2 − C1 = −0.638 ± 0.054**, and R2's correlations rho +0.232 / +0.032 —
rests on numbers with no surviving raw layer. **This is the entry-22 pattern in the phase-C
package**, and it lands on the number the entire C4/C5 registration nominates as its Gate-1
comparison target. → **corrections-log entry 25**.

**What can be said instead, labelled as the cross-check it is.** The Aug-21 B1 sweep
regenerated C1 and C2 at epoch 20 on the same chips, same inputs, same KARIOS config, seed
42 — a *different draw* from the same stochastic path, not a reproduction:

| quantity | phase-c-results.md (2026-08-19) | Aug-21 seed-42 redraw | gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 ALL median | 1.869 | 1.7939 | −0.075 |
| C2 ALL median | 0.929 | 0.9744 | +0.045 |
| C1 − pretrained | −0.530 ± 0.070 (32/130 worse) | −0.4874 ± 0.0753 (35/130) | +0.043 |
| C2 − pretrained | −1.167 ± 0.074 (8/130 worse) | −1.1869 ± 0.0654 (4/130) | −0.020 |
| **C2 − C1** | **−0.638 ± 0.054 (9/130 worse)** | **−0.6995 ± 0.0592 (14/130)** | **−0.062** |

Every gap is well inside the test-time-dropout redraw noise the project has already measured
(0.1–0.4 px per chip median, corrections-log entry 14), every sign and every verdict is
unchanged, and the C4/C5 results document **already discloses both values side by side**
("C2 − C1 (same draw family) −0.700 ± 0.059" against "C2 − C1 (committed target,
phase-c-results.md) −0.638 ± 0.054"). The reported numbers are corroborated. They are not
verified, and the difference matters: a reader who asks for the C2 − C1 raw layer cannot be
given one.

#### C.2 The stop rule — the one real deviation, and it is inherited

The registration says: *"C4's stop rule is C1's with the term renamed — if G degrades early
despite the warm-up (**G_LPIPS rising over the first two main-stage epochs**), the run stops
and reports its curves, no rescue by improvisation."* The referenced C1 rule is stated in
[phase-c-config.md](phase-c-config.md) as having two halves: a **coarse half** — "L1 rising
over the first two main-stage epochs" — and a **sharp half** — "a generator-loss spike in
the first few hundred iterations, the actual cold-D signature".

C4's per-epoch G_LPIPS means, computed here from the 5,580 logged iterations:

| epoch | 1 (warm-up) | 2 (warm-up) | **3** | **4** | **5** | … | 20 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G_LPIPS | 56.24 | 55.48 | **54.37** | **54.65** | **55.02** | … | 55.73 |

**The main stage begins at epoch 3, and G_LPIPS rises at each of the next two epochs.** The
coarse half of the registered stop rule, read literally, was met, and the run continued to
epoch 20. [phase-c-lpips-results.md](phase-c-lpips-results.md) records the rule as "**not
triggered**", justifying it as *"G_LPIPS at main-stage start (54.4) is the run minimum,
below warm-up (56.2) — no cold-D spike"* — which is the **sharp** half. Both statements in
that sentence are true (54.37 is the run minimum; it is below the warm-up level); they are
just not the test the registration names, and the substitution is not disclosed as one.

**Three things keep this from being worse than it is, and all three are load-bearing.**

1. **It is inherited, not invented for C4.** C1's own G_L1 rose at the first of its two
   main-stage transitions too — 33.582 → **34.224** → 33.858, a **rise then a fall**, not
   C4's rise at both — and C1 was likewise not stopped. The coarse half was never applied
   literally in phase C either. C4/C5 inherited an ambiguous rule and resolved it the same
   way the original run had.

   *Revised 2026-08-24, second pass:* the window these numbers come from is **confounded**
   and is recorded as the description of what the registered rule measured, not as evidence
   for why it is mis-specified. Warm-up presence is perfectly collinear with discriminator
   presence (C1 and C4 have the 2-epoch 2e-5 warm-up; C2 and C5 do not), so the first two
   main-stage transitions are exactly where the learning rate jumps 2e-5 → 1e-4. The
   mis-specification argument rests instead on the **sustained main-stage trend** — neither
   adversarial arm reduces its reconstruction loss (C1 +1.16%, flat; C4 +2.50%, rising) while
   both non-adversarial arms reduce it by ~8% (C2 −7.90%, C5 −7.54%) — and, for C4 alone, on
   the fact that its main-stage start is the run minimum with **0 of 18 main-stage epochs
   below it**, which an LR transient would not produce. **C1 does recover below its start**
   (first at epoch 7, deepest 33.118 at epoch 16, −0.46), so that half of the argument is
   C4's alone. Full statement: AMENDMENT C45-a in
   [phase-c-lpips-registration.md](phase-c-lpips-registration.md).
2. **The rule as written has no threshold.** "Rising" is unquantified; C4's rise over those
   two epochs is +0.28 then +0.37, i.e. 0.5% and 0.7%, against a series whose full-run
   spread is 54.37–56.24. A rule that fires on any positive difference would have stopped
   C1 as well, which the project plainly did not intend.
3. **The conclusion does not depend on it.** Had the run stopped at epoch 5, the registered
   primary comparison would still have fired: the dose-response sweep gives C4 − C5 =
   **+0.441 ± 0.039 (11.3 SE) at epoch 5** and **+0.254 ± 0.040 (6.4 SE) at epoch 2**. The
   effect is present at every epoch measured, at ≥ 6 SE throughout.

The deviation is therefore in the *record*, not in the science: a registered stop condition
was met on its literal reading, the run continued, and the results document reported the
rule as untriggered by applying a different test without saying so. → **entry 26**.

#### C.3 The edge-ratio mask recipe — the disclosure is accurate, the attribution is not verifiable

The registration defines input-silent as "canonical Sobel ≤ 20 on the input render", and the
results document says the five-arm recompute used "the committed B3 definition (mask = input
PNG warped to the 228 grid, BT.601, Sobel ≤ 20; validated against the committed values
before use)".

What is verifiable, and checks out: the edge operator is exactly
`hallucination_analysis.py`'s (`scipy.ndimage.sobel`, `hypot`, threshold 20.0); the mask
source is `C45/warp/input/<stem>.tif`, a 3-band 228×228 uint8 raster, one per chip, 130 of
them; the ratio is `edge_fraction(fake)/edge_fraction(real)` on the same masked pixels;
`skipped_zero_ref` is empty, so all 130 chips contributed.

What is **not** verifiable: whether that mask recipe is what B3 actually did. **B3's harness
was deleted** (corrections-log entry 22), so the committed B3 definition survives only as
prose plus three output numbers. The harness's own docstring is honest about this — it
describes the mask source as "validated against the committed B3 numbers: C2 0.2177 vs
0.218" — but the results document's phrase "the committed B3 definition" states as fact
something that rests on **agreement with one arm out of three**. The other two disagree:
pretrained 1.016 → 1.0195 (+0.0035) and C1 1.023 → 1.0457 (**+0.023**, a 2.2% shift). The
document does disclose this ("the small recompute-vs-committed offsets on pretrained/C1 are
mask-recipe sensitivity … all cross-arm comparisons here use the one-pass recompute"), which
is the right disposition and puts every five-arm comparison on one internally consistent
run. The attribution to a specific cause is a plausible hypothesis that cannot be tested
while B3's harness is gone. Recorded, not corrected; no band depends on it, since C1 clears
"near 1.0" under both values.

### C.4 phase-c

| registered | ran | status |
|---|---|---|
| C1 = adversarial (GAN + L1), Turkey-only pairs | log: `gan_mode vanilla`, `LPIPS False`, 5,577 Turkish pairs | ✓ |
| C2 = L1-only, Turkey-only pairs | log: `[C2] adversarial term zeroed`, `LPIPS False`, 5,577 pairs | ✓ |
| C3 sequential, after the C1/C2 verdict, winning arm + ~20% EU corpus | run and reported separately ([phase-c3-results.md](phase-c3-results.md)); applied to C2, per the registration's sequential design | ✓ |
| R1 — predicted winner C2 by 0.15–0.40 px | scored **and reported as partly falsified**: winner held, magnitude exceeded the band (~1.5×), and the points half explicitly recorded as FALSIFIED | ✓ |
| R2 — improvement correlates with information content, rho ≥ +0.3 | scored and reported; the document goes further and records that R1 and R2 were **mutually inconsistent as registered**, which it caught itself | ✓ |
| R3 — falsifiers of the L1-only hypothesis | scored, reported as not triggered, with the sign of the second falsifier noted as reversed | ✓ |
| R4 — fine-tuning not worth doing | scored, reported as not triggered | ✓ |
| checkpoint discipline: epoch 20 only, `latest_net_G.pth` tensor-equal to `20_net_G.pth` for both arms | **verified here: 20/20 per-epoch checkpoints and 82/82 tensors equal for C1, C2 and C3** | ✓ |
| seed 42, same schedule family, same KARIOS config | preflight lines confirm seed 42 both arms; KARIOS config identity confirmed via the `8eaa5bd8…` hash shared by every downstream package | ✓ |
| C1's stop rule, coarse half: "L1 rising over the first two main-stage epochs" | **G_L1 rose 33.582 → 34.224 at the first of those transitions and the run continued** — the same deviation as C4, in its original instance. C1 then *falls* to 33.858 (rise-then-fall, unlike C4's rise at both), and over the main stage C1 is flat (+1.16%, slope −0.001/epoch) rather than rising, recovering below its start at epoch 7 and reaching 33.118 at epoch 16 | **✗ — entry 26** |

**No registered band in phase-c went scored-but-unreported.** Every one of R1–R4 appears in
the results document with an explicit verdict, including the two that went against the
registration. That is the opposite of the entry-19 failure mode, and it is worth recording
as such: phase-c-results.md reports its own falsifications in the same prominence as its
confirmations.

`8eaa5bd8cdae066d2580a4105169262f873523cadf0b450a8aa134a31ed4ca84` is the single KARIOS
configuration hash shared by all 1,214 C45 per-run copies and by the committed master
config — the config-identity invariance, pinned as one number, and the same hash the
[B2-B3-audit.md](B2-B3-audit.md) pinned for B1, B2 and pkgA.

The C4/C5 harness is in version control at `tubitak/scripts/c45_eval/` (commit `40cde9b`),
so unlike B3 it needs no hash here: git holds it.

## Verdict — phase-c-lpips

**Leg A PASS.** Zero artifacts predate the registration commit; the whole package —
7 h 03 m of training and 29 minutes of evaluation — sits entirely between `b07e719` and
`6560c8b`, and the eval harness was committed before it produced any number. The documented
wall times are confirmed (C4 3 h 28 m against "≈ 3 h 25 m"; C5 3 h 33 m against "≈ 3 h 40 m").

**Leg B PASS on every cell backed by an artifact:** 1,300 per-chip cells, 25 per-arm summary
cells, 30 paired cells, the interaction, 25 sweep cells and 20 edge-ratio cells all
reproduce from raw.
**Note added 2026-08-26:** "the interaction" in this sentence means the interaction *cell
reproduces from raw*, which remains true and is not amended. It is not a licence to quote
the interaction — see the amended "Quotable as" ruling below. The "fourth digit" claim that validates the extension is true, verified
independently. Three transcription defects (entry 24) and one column with no traceable
origin — the secondary table's SEs — none of which touches a registered band.

**Leg C FAIL on one item.** Every registered band was scored *and* reported, including the
ones that could have gone the other way, and the one registered element that was not run
(Cappadocia recovery) is disclosed in its own section — the entry-19 failure mode does not
recur here. The failure is the stop rule (entry 26): a registered stop condition was met on
its literal reading, the run continued, and the results document reported it as untriggered
by substituting a different test.

**Quotable as:** the primary result, ~~the interaction,~~ the dose-response and the
edge-ratio mechanism are all quotable as registered and reproduced from raw, with the
stop-rule caveat attached.

**AMENDED 2026-08-26 — THE INTERACTION IS NO LONGER QUOTABLE.** This line is a
forward-acting licence, not a historical record: it tells a future writer what may go into
the paper. It is therefore amended rather than annotated, with the original struck above and
preserved. **The interaction may not be quoted in the manuscript in any form** — not the
value, not the *substitutes* band, not "the same lever". The registered seed-level reading
failed at 5/6 across six confirmatory seeds on all three registered scales and the
pre-committed consequence fired ([seed-block-results.md](seed-block-results.md) §4). Two
things replace it, and both are required rather than optional: the interaction disclosure at
[paper-context-addendum.md](paper-context-addendum.md) §24, and the out-of-range result at
[seed-block-results.md](seed-block-results.md) §5(c). **The remaining items on this line are
unaffected and stay quotable**, and the primary is now stronger than when this audit was
written, having replicated 6/6 at seed level. The 20-chip secondary row is quotable for its means, medians, point counts and
paired deltas but **its ± values must not be quoted until they are recomputed** — the
artifact's values (pretrained ± 0.1612, C1 ± 0.0712, C2 ± 0.0409, C3 ± 0.0375, C4 ± 0.0949,
C5 ± 0.0660) are the correct ones.

## Verdict — phase-c

**Leg A PASS.** The registration precedes the first line of C1's training by 3 h 19 m. The
only pre-registration artifacts are the pretrained baseline and the input/stratum files,
which the registration itself names as the baseline to beat.

**Leg B FAIL for C1 and C2.** The pretrained row reproduces (10/12 exact, the two exceptions
being the half-integer point-count convention). Nothing else can be recomputed: no per-chip
C1/C2 artifact from the 2026-08-19/20 scoring run survives, so the ten per-stratum values,
both ALL values, all three paired deltas and R2's correlations have no raw layer. The
Aug-21 seed-42 redraw corroborates every one of them within dropout noise and changes no
verdict — but corroboration by a different draw is not recomputation, and the audit says so
(entry 25).

**Leg C PASS.** Every registered parameter matches the run logs, checkpoint discipline is
verified tensor-by-tensor, and all four registered predictions R1–R4 were scored and
reported with explicit verdicts, including R1's falsified half and R2's self-caught
inconsistency. The one blemish is the stop rule, which is the same inherited item as C4's
(entry 26) and originates here.

**Quotable as:** pre-registered, with the entry-25 caveat — the C1/C2 numbers are
corroborated by a later independent redraw but cannot be recomputed from their own outputs.
The Gate-1 target −0.638 ± 0.054 that the C4/C5 package registers against is one of those
numbers; the same-draw-family value −0.6995 ± 0.0592 **is** fully reproducible and the
results document already publishes both.

## Consequence for the letter

Both halves of Table I clear, with three things that must travel with them: the secondary
row's ± column is wrong and must be replaced from the artifact before any draft quotes it
(entry 24); the phase-C C1/C2 column has no raw layer and the letter should quote the
reproducible same-draw-family value alongside the committed one, as the C4/C5 results
document already does (entry 25); and the stop-rule reading must be stated once, plainly,
rather than left as a rule the record says was untriggered (entry 26).

Base rate after six audited registrations: **three timeline claims verified true** (T1, B2/B3,
phase-c-lpips) plus phase-c, **one falsified** (E3); **five registrations carrying disclosed
protocol deviations** (T1 entry 17, B2 entry 19, B3 entries 20–22, phase-c-lpips entries
24/26, phase-c entries 25/26). The manuscript wording rule is unchanged and further
evidenced.

Remaining in [paper-roadmap.md](paper-roadmap.md) item 1: `phase-c-europe-registration`,
`phase-d-checks-registration`, `packageA-registration`, the four `tool-*registration` files,
T3.
