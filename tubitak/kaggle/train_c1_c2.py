# Kaggle notebook script - Phase C arms C1 (GAN+L1) and C2 (L1-only)
# Dataset "gencp-tr" mounted at /kaggle/input/gencp-tr
# Full rationale: tubitak/docs/phase-c-config.md ; registration: phase-c-registration.md
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHANGELOG 19 Aug 2026 - Kaggle bring-up. Reasoning recorded in phase-c-config.md.
#
#   1. preflight()            Assert from inside the running kernel that a CUDA device is
#                             actually visible and that the dataset is actually mounted,
#                             before anything expensive starts. The metadata claiming
#                             enable_gpu is not evidence that torch can see a GPU.
#
#   2. make_cold_start_D()    No discriminator was ever released for these weights.
#                             --continue_train makes base_model.setup() call
#                             load_networks('latest'), which loops over model_names
#                             ['G','D'] and calls torch.load() with NO existence check.
#                             Without a latest_net_D.pth the run dies before iteration 1.
#                             D is therefore built here, through the repository's own
#                             define_D -> init_net -> init_weights path, seeded, and its
#                             provenance is written next to it and printed every run.
#
#   3. "--seed","42" removed  This fork has no --seed option anywhere in options/, and
#                             BaseOptions.gather_options() ends in parser.parse_args()
#                             (strict), so argparse would exit 2 with
#                             "unrecognized arguments: --seed 42" on the FIRST call of
#                             both arms. Seeding moved to install_seed_hook() below,
#                             which seeds the training process itself. The seed is not
#                             dropped; it is applied where it can actually take effect.
#
#   4. "--print_freq","10"    Logging only, no effect on the optimisation. At batch 4 there
#                             are 1394 iterations per epoch, so the default print_freq 100
#                             yields 3-4 rows over the first few hundred iterations, which
#                             is precisely the window the cold-start stop rule watches.
#
#   5. torchmetrics guard     models/pix2pix_model.py imports torchmetrics at module level
#                             and constructs LearnedPerceptualImagePatchSimilarity(...).cuda()
#                             unconditionally in __init__, NOT only under --LPIPS. It is not
#                             in requirements.txt, so its presence is checked here.
#
#   NO hyperparameter was changed. lr, n_epochs, n_epochs_decay, epoch_count, batch_size,
#   load_size, crop_size, direction, netG, norm, model, save_epoch_freq and the two-stage
#   C1 warm-up structure are byte-identical to the version registered in phase-c-config.md.

# C5 1.0906. Highest anywhere in those four runs, outside the window included: 1.8792 (C2).
# Threshold 2.5 is 1.59x the highest windowed value and 1.33x the highest value seen anywhere
# in four runs that all finished normally. All six stage-windows were replayed through this
# exact code and produce zero hits. The margin is printed at run time so a reader sees it
# rather than trusting it.
#
# The quantity is the RECONSTRUCTION loss (G_L1, or G_LPIPS on the C4/C5 arms), not G_GAN,
# for a mechanistic reason and not a convenience one: the failure this gate exists to catch is
# cold-D damage to the GENERATOR, which shows up as degraded output quality, and the
# reconstruction loss measures output quality directly. G_GAN measures the state of the
# adversarial game - how well a discriminator initialised from noise is currently separating
# G's output - which is EXPECTED to swing hard early as D learns. That swing is the game
# equilibrating, not evidence of damage, so G_GAN is the wrong quantity for a damage detector
# regardless of its variance. Supporting evidence, not the argument: G_GAN in normal training
# reaches 3.75x on C1 and 2.85x on C4 against this same statistic, so a G_GAN detector at this
# threshold would also have false-fired on healthy runs.
#
# It is a NOVELTY detector, not a validated divergence test. It catches a run that looks
# unlike anything we have seen. It has never been shown to catch divergence, because
# divergence has never been observed here. Prospective only, like AMENDMENT C45-a.
